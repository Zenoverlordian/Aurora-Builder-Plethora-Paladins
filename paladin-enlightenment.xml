        <description>
            <p><em>How many people here have telekinetic powers? Raise my hand.</em></p>
            <p style="text-align:right">â€”Emo Philips</p>
            <p>The Oath of Enlightenment is a sacred vow of self-development sworn by servants of psychic gods and orders of mystic practitioners. Called mindswords, these paladins blend their divine magics with rigorous self-discipline to hone psionic power. Through strict adherence to ascetic living and ponderous meditation, mindswords unlock the hidden powers of the mind, bolstering the strength of their will and the might of their flesh.</p>
            <h5>TENETS OF ENLIGHTENMENT</h5>
            <p>The Oath of Enlightenment rejects the rest of the world, preferring to find might and right in personal development.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Discipline.</em></strong> The mind is stronger than the body. Tame all your appetites, for they can only debase you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dispassion.</em></strong> The psyche is wiser than the heart. Temper all your passions, for they can only mislead you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Detachment.</em></strong> The will is mightier than the world. Refrain from deep personal connections, for they can only limit you.</p>

            <h5>ENLIGHTENING MEDITATIONS</h5>
            <p>Mental discipline is paramount to a mindsword's power, and for most that is best cultivated through careful, deliberate meditation. Your paladin's meditative technique may be a reflection of their personal tastes or of the inherited teachings of a mystic order they are part of. Consider some of the ideas from the following table, or make up your own meditative technique for your paladin.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Meditative Technique</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>You've mastered a technique to meditate while balanced upon only your head.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Waterfalls. You always want to sit under waterfalls.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Rather than meditate by sitting, you like to foster contemplation and self-control through all-day fasts.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You plug your ears and blindfold yourself while meditating. Isolation helps you focus.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>When you meditate, you do not breathe, relying on careful mental control of your body's functions to survive without air for minutes, even hours.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You carefully shave your head as part of a daily meditative ritual.</td></tr>

            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mind Over Matter.</em></strong> You can augment your body with the might of your mind. When you would fail a saving throw to maintain concentration on a paladin spell, you can use your Channel Divinity as a reaction to succeed instead.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Phantom Smite.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action to begin channeling psionic energy to transcend physical limitations. For 1 minute, your reach increases by 5 feet, and when you damage a creature with a weapon attack or with your Divine Smite or Improved Divine Smite features, you can choose to inflict psychic damage instead of the normal damage type. Also, when you make a melee attack while under this effect, you ignore half and cover and three-quarters cover.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can end this effect on your turn (no action required), and it ends early if you are unconscious.</p>
