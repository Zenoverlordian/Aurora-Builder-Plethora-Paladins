        <description>
            <p><em>The present is theirs. The future, for which I really worked, is mine.</em></p>
            <p style="text-align:right">â€”Nikola Tesla</p>
            <p>To some, the age of a world is marked by its changes: the advancements and progress made in thought, machinery, and life. The club gives way to the spear, then the sword; crude sorceries and pacts give way to wizardly arcana; and the wandering tribe becomes a village, then a city, then an empire. Society itself grows, shaking off yesterday's norms and tinkering with new ways of existence. Those who swear the oath of tomorrow, known as tomorrowbringers, believe in the virtue of this progress and strive to push the world forward. Be they pure machinists or fiery advocates for social rearrangement, these paladins wield powers from their personal vision of the future as they quest to put an end to the most recent chapter of history.</p>
            <h5>TENETS OF TOMORROW</h5>
            <p>The tenets of tomorrow are a newly crafted vow, often mutating to better fit the rapidly progressing world tomorrowbringers seek after.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Effect Change.</em></strong> Stagnation is death. Always drive experimentation, new ways of thinking, and cultural progress.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Pure Reason.</em></strong> Mortals should be rational beings. The power of your reason will unlock secrets to greater futures.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mortals are Limitless.</em></strong> Defy the irrational chains placed upon what mortal civilization can and cannot accomplish. There is a future grandeur just waiting to be achieved.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Kill the Past.</em></strong> The society of the past did not know what you do now. It is a scar reminding mortals of what they thought they couldn't do. Let history die in its cobwebs.</p>

            <h5>WONDROUS INVENTIONS</h5>
            <p>Not all tomorrowbringers are crafters and inventors, but some are. Perhaps your paladin has devised a wondrous, if peculiar, invention, taking the form of a tiny trinket. You may find such a trinket you like on the following table, or you can work with your Dungeon Master to create one of your own.</p>

            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Empower Invention.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can infuse one melee weapon you hold with electric power, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, the weapon inflicts lightning damage, instead of its normal damage type, and it emits dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature hit by this weapon can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can end this effect on your turn (no action required). If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Stroke of Genius.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to enter a frenzy of miraculous ingenuity. For 10 minutes, if your total for any Intelligence check you make is less than 15, you use 15 in place of the total.</p>
